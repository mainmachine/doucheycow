# doucheycow

This is a simple script to read an RSS feed, randomly select one entry, and display it through cowthink.

Should be easy to modify for Cowsay, frogs, etc. and any RSS feed of your choice.

My application of this is to add it to the end of /etc/profile on my VPS, so when I log in I'm treated
to a random douchey account guy saying. :)

Enjoy!
